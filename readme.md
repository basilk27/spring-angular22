# Angular2, TypeScript, Spring Security and Spring Boot

This is a reimplementation of the awesome blog series of [Dave Syer](https://spring.io/team/dsyer) in which he explains
  how to use Angular.js and Spring Security to build a modern webapp.   
The series consists of six parts:

1. [A Secure Single Page Application](http://spring.io/blog/2015/01/12/spring-and-angular-js-a-secure-single-page-application)
2. [The Login Page](http://spring.io/blog/2015/01/12/the-login-page-angular-js-and-spring-security-part-ii)
3. [The Resource Server](https://spring.io/blog/2015/01/20/the-resource-server-angular-js-and-spring-security-part-iii)
4. [The API Gateway Pattern](http://spring.io/blog/2015/01/28/the-api-gateway-pattern-angular-js-and-spring-security-part-iv)
5. [SSO with OAuth2](https://spring.io/blog/2015/02/03/sso-with-oauth2-angular-js-and-spring-security-part-v)
6. [Multiple UI Applications and a Gateway](https://spring.io/blog/2015/03/23/multiple-ui-applications-and-a-gateway-single-page-application-with-spring-and-angular-js-part-vi)

## Motivation

I wanted to get my hands dirty with angular and spring boot. So I am going to implement the solution shown in the blog
  and change the client code to use [Angular 2](http://angular.io) (once it comes out of alpha), 
  [Material Design](https://material.angularjs.org), [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) and 
  [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/).
And - as a side effect - I am constantly looking for a new technology stack to use for new projects at 
[smartsteuer](http://www.smartsteuer.de) where I happen to work.

## Feedback

I am very interested in what you think. Am I using anything wrong or could it be done better/different? 
Do you have a question about this project? 
 Just create a ticket.
